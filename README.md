# MorseCodeToEnglishAndViceVersa
Here we have made a convertor that will convert a morse code to its equivalent english language and vice versa also.
What is a Morse Code??
Morse Code is widely used for international data transmission, it is more secured and scientific. It is based on a structure of a binary search tree where useful characters, numbers and symbols are placed at particular position. 
In that binary tree if we move left, then we concider it as a .(dot) and if we move right, it will be considered as _(dash).
[Where .(dot) takes a single bit and _(dash) takes 3 bits]

Here, we made the converter in Python3!!!
